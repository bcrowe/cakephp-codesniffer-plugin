# My CakePHP core Code Sniffer

This code works with [phpcs](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-codesniffer.php)
and checks code against a modified version of the coding standards used in CakePHP.

NEW: Now it also has auto-fixing for almost all sniffs using the `phpcs-fixer` branch.

## Installation

### Usage

After installation you can check code compliance to the standard using
`phpcs`:

	phpcs --standard=MyCakePHPCore /path/to/code
